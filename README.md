 # Die Racer
 ## Dice Racing software as an elementary example of Monte Carlo simulations with well-defined models
 This software uses Python random number generators to simulate the rolling of various numbers of dice of various sizes and produces plots of the rounning total of those dice to produce a simulated race between the die types over a defined number of rolls.
